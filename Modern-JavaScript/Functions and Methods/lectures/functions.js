// FUNCTIONS

// NOTES:
/* 
// What are functions?
- as a data type, they fall under OBJECTS
- they are reusable blocks of code
- bit like a box with a label on it, we name the function (box) and we can use whatever is inside multiple times
- good example is when a user presses a button on a webpage, we would want it to run the block of code that is to do with the button as many times as is needed, depending how often the button is pressed
- Methods and functions are similar but have slight differences which we will learn about later
