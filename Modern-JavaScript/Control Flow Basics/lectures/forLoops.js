// FOR LOOPS

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("loop..", i);
}
console.log("loop finished");
/* NOTES:
- many loops in js
- don't need ; to close a loop
- let i = 0; known as a counter
- i < 5; known as condition
- if true execute the code
- i++ 
- don't usually know how many times to loop through, usually check through a chunk of data
