// COMMON STRING METHODS

let email = "dug@thepupdug.co.uk";

let result = email.lastIndexOf("t");
console.log(result); // 4

// NOTES:
/*
- methods are just functions that belong to a specific object
- we want to find the last occuring index of (whatever we put), in this case its the string "t".
    . we do that by using the method .lastIndexOf
    . the result of the method we store in a variable called result, so we just need to call result in the . console.log later.
