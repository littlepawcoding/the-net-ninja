// Data Types at a Glance.

// Numbers - all numbers, including decimals
// Strings - usually text, surrounded by " " or ' '
// Boolean - true or false
// Null - variable that has no value that is purposly set by us
// Undefined - empty values but given automatically
// Objects - arrays, object literals
// Symbol

// JS loosly typed language, meaning the code would most likely run even with small syntax errors like forgetting a semi colon ;
